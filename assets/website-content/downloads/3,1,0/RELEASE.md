Dear community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation, I am proud to announce that Haxe 3.1.0 is now officially released! It is available at http://haxe.org/download.

Our main focus for this release was on improving stability and fixing bugs. Nevertheless, several new features were introduced as well. Make sure to check out the changelog (http://haxe.org/file/CHANGES.txt).

This Haxe release also comes with an updated haxelib client which saw several bugfixes and improvements compared to the one included in the Haxe 3.0 release.

We removed the outdated haxedoc tool in favor of Dox (https://github.com/dpeek/dox). Dox will be updated on Haxelib soon for easy access.

I would like to thank both our old and new contributors, in particular:

 - Andy Li for getting Haxe properly tested on Travis CI (<https://travis-ci.org/HaxeFoundation/haxe>)
 - Dan Korostelev for various improvements to the C# target and other contributions
 - Bryan Ischo of TiVo for his work on the hxcpp debugger (<https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/hxcpp-debugger>)
 - Cauê Waneck for setting up the automated Haxe binaries and installers (<http://builds.haxe.org/>)
 - Mike Welsh for his work on the Int32 and Int64 abstracts

If you want to appear on this list for the next release, make sure to check us out on [GitHub](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation).

Thank you for your support

Simon Krajewski
