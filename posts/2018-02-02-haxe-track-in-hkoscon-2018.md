The annual [Hong Kong Open Source Conference](https://www.facebook.com/hkoscon/) (HKOSCon) has been one of the major developer events in the city. There have been hundreds of participates, with a large number of oversea visitors, attending talks and workshops each year.

I personally am a huge fan of the conference and spoke about Haxe there a few times:

 * An introductory talk about [Haxe and its role as a transpiler](https://2015.opensource.hk/agenda/topic/transcompiling-towards-the-freedom-of-programming-language-and-platform-choice/) in 2015.
 * A sharing of my experience with [packaging Haxe for the Linux distributions](https://2016.opensource.hk/topics/apt-get-install-my-software-packaging-for-linux/) in 2016.
 * [A beginner's workshop](https://hkoscon.org/2017/topics/build-a-cross-platform-game-in-haxe/) co-hosted with [Kevin Leung](https://twitter.com/kevinresol) in 2017.

This year, HKOSCon introduced [a community track program](https://hkoscon.org/2018/cfc.html) which allows individual communities to manage their own tracks in the conference - from the call for proposal and the selection of speakers to hosting the taks. Each community track will comprise of two or more 30-minute sessions. Together with Mozilla, the LikeCoin Foundation, and many others,  theHaxe Foundation is proud to be one of the [selected communities](https://www.facebook.com/hkoscon/posts/2047516342183239)!

This is super exciting because it will be the first official Haxe event in the Asian region. Remember that we have also just announced [Haxe Summit in the US](https://haxe.org/blog/seattle-haxe-summit-2018/)? Awesome! This is certainly a good year for Haxers to travel around the world :)

## Call for Proposals

Now, we are calling on you for proposals for the Haxe Track at HKOSCon 2018. We will welcome any Haxe-related topics such as the sharing of Haxe programming techniques, an introduction to Haxe libraries and frameworks, or showcases of games/websites/apps built with Haxe. If it has Haxe inside, come present it!

The tentative date of HKOSCon 2018 is 2-3 June (Saturday - Sunday). The venue is to be confirmed (in Hong Kong for sure).

To submit a proposal, please fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdEA_221T_GZr2icxNrfgvR_PUq4uc9coDJZJeM2v5G5VnU2Q/viewform?usp=sf_link) on or before 25 March 2018.
