# Haxe Summit 2018 in Seattle

Back in September, we had a beautiful and very successful Haxe Summit in Amsterdam with lots of exciting talks,
workshops and opportunities to connect with other members of the community.

On one of the coffee breaks, we found ourselves discussing the possibility of putting on a conference in the US with Douglas Pearson,
CTO at our strategic partner FlowPlay. He brought the idea back home with him and after a few weeks and some e-mails back and forth,
we had a very productive Skype Meeting with Derrick Morton (FlowPlay’s CEO), Docler’s events team and some representatives of the
Haxe Foundation, to discuss what it would take to bring a Haxe Conference to the US. We discovered, that it would be a lot of work
but also very doable with good planning.

Thus, we are happy to announce that yes, we will have a Haxe Conference in the US in 2018. You can book the dates:

**When** : 3th-5th May 2018

**Where** : The Hilton Seattle Downtown, Seattle, Washington, USA

We still have some details regarding pricing, sponsorships and the schedule to nail down but we’ll make sure to let you know
as soon as possible. At the moment, we have confirmed the venue and the dates and secured a special rate for accommodations
with the hotel.

In the meantime:

 * Think about giving a presentation or a workshop!
 * Block the dates in your calendar!
 * Get involved!

Cheers,
