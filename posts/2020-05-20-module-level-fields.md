# Module-level fields are here!

I am happy to announce that we've [just merged](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/pull/8460) a new Haxe feature: module-level functions and variables (AKA module-level fields)!

This means that Haxe now supports declaring static fields outside of classes, directly in modules next to type declarations:

```haxe
typedef Greeting = {phrase:String};

function greet(greeting:Greeting) {
	trace(greeting.phrase);
}

final defaultGreeting:Greeting = {phrase: "Hello, world!"};

function main() {
	greet(defaultGreeting);
}
```

The code above is more or less equivalent to the good old static fields:

```haxe
typedef Greeting = {phrase:String};

class MyModule {
	public static function greet(greeting:Greeting) {
		trace(greeting.phrase);
	}

	public static final defaultGreeting:Greeting = {phrase: "Hello, world!"};

	public static function main() {
		greet(defaultGreeting);
	}
}
```

In fact, the compiler internally transforms such module-level declarations into static fields of an implicitly created class, so they behave the same way.

## Using module-level fields

From the usage standpoint, module-level fields are as well not very different from static fields. However since they are declared at the _module-level_, they share some rules with the other kind of module-level declarations: _types_, the most important to keep in mind being:

 - module-level fields are publicly available by default, but can be explicitly made `private`
 - importing a module will import all its fields (together with all its types)

## Macros

We can also spot this duality if we take a look at the new macro structures:

In the *untyped* AST (`haxe.macro.Expr`) there is a new [`TypeDefKind`](https://api.haxe.org/v/development/haxe/macro/TypeDefKind.html) variant: `TDStatic(kind:FieldType, ?access:Array<Access>)`. Basically we use the old [`TypeDefinition`](https://api.haxe.org/v/development/haxe/macro/TypeDefinition.html) structure together with [`Context.defineType`](https://api.haxe.org/v/development/haxe/macro/Context.html#defineType) or [`Context.defineModule`](https://api.haxe.org/v/development/haxe/macro/Context.html#defineModule) to define a module-level field in a macro.

> *It may be argued that with the introduction of module-level fields, the naming is a bit confusing, since it's not only about **type** definitions anymore, but it is not worth breaking existing macro code by changing the structures*.

In the *typed* AST (`haxe.macro.Type`) there is a new [`ClassKind`](https://api.haxe.org/v/development/haxe/macro/ClassKind.html) variant: `KModuleStatics(module:String)`, which indicates that the class in question is the one containing all the module-level fields defined for this `module`.

This implementation allowed for introducing this feature in the least invasive and breaking way and it automatically works on all targets!

## Code generation

Speaking of the targets, on the generator side, they can choose to "flatten" `KModuleStatics` classes back into series of function/variable declarations. This is already implemented for the JavaScript target, so if our example module is actually called "MyModule", the generated code for the module-level fields from the example above will be:

```js
function MyModule_main() {
	MyModule_greet(MyModule_defaultGreeting);
}
function MyModule_greet(greeting) {
	console.log("src/MyModule.hx:4:",greeting.phrase);
}
var MyModule_defaultGreeting = { phrase : "Hello, world!"};
```

## Use-cases

We believe this feature will make it more pleasant to develop code in non-OOP paradigms. An obvious example would be functional programming, which focuses more on functions and passive data structures, but there is room for class-less functions in any code, no matter the style.

### Utilities and static extensions

Almost any codebase has helper methods that don't belong to a data type and now they can be defined without redundant syntax. Same goes for [static extensions](https://haxe.org/manual/lf-static-extension.html)!

### Macros

[Haxe macros](https://haxe.org/manual/macro.html) are often written in simple procedural style, which makes them good candidates to become module-level functions.

### Scripts

Did you know it is possible to use Haxe as a scripting language? It only makes sense: the Haxe compiler already has a built-in interpreter for running macros (`eval`), so why not use it for general scripting? That is exactly what the `--run` compiler argument is for! And with the addition of module-level functions it's much easier to write such scripts. Here's one:

```haxe
function main() {
	Sys.println(Sys.args().join(" "));
}
```

Run it with `haxe --run Script hello world` and you'll get a `hello world`. Neat! ðŸ‘Œ

*One particularly active member of the Haxe and Flixel communities is already making use of this feature for scripting, check out [setup-flixel](https://github.com/HaxeFlixel/setup-flixel) for some inspiration!*

## Closing words

Module-level fields will be available in the next minor Haxe release (4.2), but of course if you're living on the edge and don't want to wait, please grab a [nightly build](https://build.haxe.org/) and try it out (and don't forget to report any issues you find!)
