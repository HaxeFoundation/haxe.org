Dear community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation I am proud to announce that Haxe 3.4.0-rc1 is now officially released! It is available along with the changelog at <http://haxe.org/download>.

We went from the 3.3.0 RC to a new version because many things changed internally. The [HashLink](http://hashlink.haxe.org/) target is now fully operational and the compiler had many improvements to its IDE support capabilities.

Despite this being labeled a new minor version, we've fixed tons of bugs and implemented a variety of general improvements. Overall code output quality has increased further and several minor optimizations are in place.

Please test your Haxe code with this version and let us know if you come across any problems at <https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues>.

Thank you for your support
