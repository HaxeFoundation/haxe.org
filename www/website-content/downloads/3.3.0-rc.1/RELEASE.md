Dear community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation I am proud to announce that Haxe 3.3.0-rc1 is now officially released! It is available along with the changelog at <http://haxe.org/download>.

This release introduces the new Lua target which was developed by Justin Donaldson. As with any new target it should be considered to be in beta stage.

Other major features include a rewritten static analyzer which is now enabled by default. Furthermore, the C++ target generator has seen a major overhaul.

As usual, there have also been lots of bugfixes and improvements in various areas. There have also been a few small breaking changes which we documented at <https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/wiki/Breaking-changes-in-Haxe-3.3.0>.

Please test your Haxe code with this version and let us know if you come across any problems at <https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues>.

Thank you for your support
