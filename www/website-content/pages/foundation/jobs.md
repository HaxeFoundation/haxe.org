Gamesys is on a mission to become the world’s most entertaining online gaming company. It all started with Jackpotjoy but along the way we have grown into the award-winning team of designers, developers and operators behind some of the leading gaming sites and apps including Virgin Games and Caesar’s Casino. But, we haven’t stopped there... we’re also behind Bingo Lane, Jackpotjoy Slots and other great free-to-play games. 

Born in 2001 with just a handful of developers, we are now over 900 employees strong across 7 group offices worldwide with our headquarters in Central London.  Over 25 million players enjoy our 258 games, generating on average 6,028 chat messages every 15 minutes!
