<h1>The Haxe Foundation</h1>

<p>After years of open source development, the <b>Haxe Foundation</b> was created to fund long term Haxe development and provide support to companies using Haxe.</p>

<p>The goals of the Haxe Foundation are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To support the whole Haxe ecosystem by funding core technologies</li>
	<li>To provide a single point of contact for companies that wish to evaluate Haxe as a potential solution</li>
	<li>To offer Paid Support Plans ensuring that somebody will always be available to answer the phone when you need help</li>
	<li>To help the Haxe Open Source Community by organizing events and user groups</li>
</ul>
