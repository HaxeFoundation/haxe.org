Dear community,

We just released Haxe 3.1.1 with various fixes. It is available at <http://haxe.org/download>

Although originally intended as a pure bugfix release, three minor new features found their way in. Make sure to check out the changelog (<http://haxe.org/file/CHANGES.txt>).

Thank you for your support

Simon Krajewski
