> **Note:**
>
> - Static typing: Yes - means the target platform natively [supports static typing](https://haxe.org/manual/types-nullability.html); Haxe code itself is statically typed no matter what target it is compiled to
> - Sys: Yes - means the target supports the [System API](http://api.haxe.org/Sys.html)
> - String encoding - see the [Encoding section](https://haxe.org/manual/std-String-encoding.html) of the manual for target-specifics.
>
> **Tiers:**
>
> - Tier 1 - actively maintained by the core compiler team with a strong focus from the Haxe Foundation
> - Tier 2 - mostly maintained by individuals, but still managed by the Haxe Foundation
> - Tier 3 - kept up-to-date, but not much active development
