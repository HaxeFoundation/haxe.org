### The Haxe Compiler: GPLv2+

The Haxe compiler is released under the GNU General Public License version 2 or any later version.  This ensures the Haxe compiler will remain free and open source.

The license requires the users distributing modified versions of the Haxe compiler to also distribute the source code, licensed under the same license. Therefore distributing proprietary/non-free versions of the Haxe compiler is not allowed.

The license of the compiler does not affect the license of your own source code. If you use Haxe and the Haxe compiler it is not required that you release your work (including output generated by the Haxe compiler) under a free open source software license.

### The Haxe Standard Library: MIT

Since Haxe 3, the Haxe Standard Library has been licensed under a MIT style license, which does not require the notices to be reproduced anywhere outside of the actual library code.
