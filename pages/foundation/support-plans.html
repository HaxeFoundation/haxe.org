<p><b>Technologies Covered:</b> the support plans cover the Haxe compiler and the full Haxe standard library. If you have an issue with a Haxe Foundation-sponsored technology, we will also contact the technology author and do our best so it gets fixed quickly, although this might take more time since people not working for the Foundation might get involved.</p>

<p>If you want to get paid support or if you have any question regarding our paid support plans, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@haxe.org">contact@haxe.org</a>.</p>
