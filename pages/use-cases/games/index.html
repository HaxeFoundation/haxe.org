			<p>What I love about Haxe is how it lets me get a game up and running quickly, yet it's still fast and robust enough to work well all the way through the process. </p>
			<p>Being flexible with platforms is also key, I ended up porting to ones I had no idea about when I started my project. I couldn't have done this without support for such a wide array of platforms.</p>
