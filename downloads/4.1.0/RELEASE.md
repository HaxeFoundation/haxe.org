Dear Community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation, we are proud to announce the official release of Haxe 4.1.0!

This time, we've focused on a smaller set of features to keep the release cycle short.

The most notable changes:

- the JVM target is no longer experimental
- we reworked exception handling.

We've gone into more detail about that in [this blog post](haxe.org/blog/haxe-4.1.0-release/).

Haxe 4.1.0 also includes over one hundred other additions, optimizations, improvements, and bugfixes.

Check out the changelog below for more information.

If you have any suggestions or run into any problems, absolutely [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues).

Thanks to everyone involved!
