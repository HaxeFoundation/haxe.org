Dear Community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation, we are proud to announce the official release of Haxe 4.3.5!

This release includes a number of bugfixes, as well as some nice things we
thought would be useful before Haxe 5 release:

 * Mac OS universal binaries, now supporting Apple Silicon
 * Json RPC Diagnostics, to be used with the upcoming version 2.32.0 of [vshaxe](https://github.com/vshaxe/vshaxe)

Check out the changelog below for more information.

If you have any suggestions or run into any problems, feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues).

Thanks to everyone involved!
