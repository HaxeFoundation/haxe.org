Dear Community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation I am proud to announce that Haxe 3.4.5 is now officially released! It is available along with the changelog at <https://haxe.org/download>.

This release improves DCE performance and addresses a few issues fixed after previous release.

Please test your Haxe code with this version and let us know if you come across any problems at <https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues>3.

Thank you for your support.
