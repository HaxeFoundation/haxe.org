Dear Community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation we are proud to announce that Haxe 4.0.3 is now officially released!

In this bugfix release we focused on fixing regressions and reworked the windows installer to avoid false positives from anti-virus software.

See the changelog below for further details. If you have any suggestions or run into any problems, donâ€™t hesitate to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues).

- To migrate from Haxe 3, read the overview of [breaking changes](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/wiki/Breaking-changes-in-Haxe-4.0.0).

We want to thank everyone involved and hope to see your codebases transition to Haxe 4 soon!
