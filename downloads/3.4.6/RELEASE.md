Dear Community,

On behalf of the Haxe Foundation I am proud to announce that Haxe 3.4.6 is now officially released! It is available along with the changelog at <https://haxe.org/download>.

This is a hotfix release which addresses an issue with the path of standard library on Linux if Haxe is executed by another program.

Please test your Haxe code with this version and let us know if you come across any problems at <https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe/issues>.

Thank you for your support.
